# Match Game

In this project, I have created a **Match Game** that showcases several features and utilizes a variety of technologies.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users match images to score points.
- **Countdown Timer**: The game features a 60-second countdown.
- **Dynamic Image & Tab Switching**: Content updates based on user interactions.
- **Scorecard Display**: The final score is shown with an option to replay.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Built with reusable components for a dynamic UI.
- **Vite**: Ensures fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides efficient and responsive styling.
- **ESLint**: Maintains code quality and consistency.
